# OpenBG-IMG Benchmark

OpenBG-IMG is a multi-modal dataset in the field of e-commerce. This benchmark implements a variety of knowledge graph embedding models for link prediction, which is used to generate evaluation results of [CCKS2022 Knowledge Processing and Application Evaluation for Digital Commerce Task 3: Multimodal Commodity Knowledge Graph Link Prediction](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/531957/introduction). Please submit the results to TIANCHI platform.

# Requirements

Use the following code to configure the environment.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Dataset

Please download the dataset from TIANCHI to the directory `./data/`.

```

# Quick Start


## TransE & TransH & TransE & DistMult & ComplEx

These models refer to the implement of [OpenKE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE).

- Compile C++ files

```shell
    cd [The root directory of model]
    bash scripts/make.sh
```

- Preprocess data

```shell
    bash scripts/prepro.sh
```

- Train model and predict results saved to `./results/result.tsv`


```shell
    bash scripts/train.sh
```

## TuckER

The model refers to the implement of [TuckER](https://github.com/ibalazevic/TuckER).

- Preprocess data

```shell
    bash scripts/prepro.sh
```

- Train model and predict results saved to `./results/result.tsv`


```shell
    bash scripts/train.sh
```

## TransAE

The model refers to the implement of the TransE model in [OpenKE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE) and the process of images in [TransAE](https://github.com/ksolaiman/TransAE).

- Compile C++ files

```shell
    cd TransAE
    bash scripts/make.sh
```

- Preprocess data

```shell
    bash scripts/prepro.sh
```

- Get representations and encodings of images


```shell
    bash scripts/visual_emb.sh
```

- Train model and predict results saved to `./results/result.tsv`


```shell
    bash scripts/train.sh
```

## RSME

The model refers to the implement of [RSME](https://github.com/wangmengsd/RSME).

- Get representations and encodings of images

```shell
    cd RSME
    bash scripts/visual_emb.sh
```

- Preprocess data

```shell
    bash scripts/prepro.sh
```

- Train model and predict results saved to `./results/result.tsv`

```shell
    bash scripts/train.sh
```
